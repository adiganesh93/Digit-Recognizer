# Digit-Recognizer
 The goal is to recognize digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images.
In this report we will be Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine on the 'Digit Recognizer' dataset to predict the digits 0 to 9 in handwriting images. We will also be experimenting with the algorithms by changing the parameters and tuning it, use cross validation technique to increase model performance.
